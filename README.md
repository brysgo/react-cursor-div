# DEPRECATED

This project doesn't make much sense anymore now that react hooks exist. Try something like a [useHover](https://medium.com/@penx/usehover-react-hook-comparison-2b97b7fc0549)


# react-cursor-div

ReactCursorDiv is a really simple component that behaves just like a div, except it follows you mouse cursor. It is useful if you want a simple way to position your tooltips.

See example in demo folder for usage.
